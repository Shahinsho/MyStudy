## Step 1- Create a Repository
- Repository can be defined as a folder (a central location in which data is stored and managed).  
1- click on + sign to create a new repository    
2- name your repository (FEWD-a01)  
3- select **"Public"** radio button option  
4- select **"Initialize this repository with a README"** option (square)  

## Step 2- Create a Branch:
- Duplicate the master and give it a new name   
1- go to **"FEWD-a01"**, the new repository  
2- click the drop-down menu **"Branch: Master"**  
3- type a branch name **"modify-readme"**  
4- click on the blue button **"Create branch modify-readme"**   

## Step 3- Make and Commit Changes
- Now you are in **"Branch: modify-readme"**, and in the code view    
So far, we have 1 commit, 2 branches, 1 contributer  
1- click on **"README.md"** file (it is a text link to this file)  
2- click on the *pencil* icon  
3- write your content per instruction on video (**Working with Markdown**)  
4- under **"Commit changes"**, write a **"commit message"** that describes your changes  
5- the radio button for the **Commit directly to the "modify-readme" branch** is selected  
6- click **"Commit changes"** button  
These changes will be made to just the README file on your **"modify-readme"** branch.  
(so the content on this branch is different from master)  

## Step 4- Open a Pull Request
- Now you **"Open a Pull"** to propose the changes you made, and to request that your team member to:  
  1- review and pull in your contribution  
  2- and merge them into their branch  
- Pull request shows *diffs*, or differences, from the contents of the both branches.  
- As soon as you make a commit, you can open a pull request  
- You can even pull request on your own repository  
1- click the **"PULL REQUEST"** tab  
2- from the pull request page click the **"New Pull Request"** button (green)  
3- select the branch you made **"modify-readme"** to compare with the master (the two are side-by-side buttons under **"Open a pull request"** headline)  
4- now look over the changes in the diffs on the compare page to make sure changes are as you wanted  
5- click on big green **"Create Pull Request"** button  
6- give this pull request a "title" and write a brief **"description"** of changes you made  
7- click **"CREATE PULL REQUEST"**   

## Step 5- Merge your Pull Request
- Merge will bring your modified-readme branch into master branch  
1- click on **"Merge pull request"** button  
2- click **"Confirm merge"**  
  
## Step 6- Delete Branch
- Normally if you are completely done with the branch and don't need it anymore, you can delete it.  
1- click **"Delete branch"** button (purple)
